Solar Panel System

The project:
I start this project because, I bought a solar panel and I wish build a system capable of control it. 
Basic functions:
•	Emergency break
•	Switcher line (switch between the solar energy or the energy of the company).
•	Alert about the state of the system and the produced energy.
Components:	
•	Hardware:
o	Arduino UNO.
o	Controller board (built by myself) (gonna have thyristors).
o	USB cable (Through this way I’m going to make the connection, more later I will replace it for an ethernet cable).
o	Circuit breaker.
o	Solar panel.
o	Batteries (I’m going to make an off-grid system first) (the first will be of car type).
o	Batterie charger/Solar panel Controller.
•	Software:
o	Arduino logic.
o	Python script for make the connection between the mobile or PC.
o	C# Interface (the last thing to do).
o	Flutter for mobile interface (or could be written with c# also with Xamarin).
